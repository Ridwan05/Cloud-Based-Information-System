# Cloud-Based Information System for a Poultry Farm
This is a final project for my masters program at Ahmadu Bello University

The aim of my project is to create and deploy a cloud-based information system that will be utilized to manage production and sales records of a Poultry Farm.  
The following are the objectives of the project:  

1.	To develop a database application that will store and provide information on the farmâ€™s daily output and sales, as well as aid in the presentation of farm income and expense reports.
2.	To design and implement a system that will make it easier to update production and sales records.

## Scope
This research focuses on the development and deployment of a cloud-based information system for a poultry farm. It is limited to creating and deploying a cloud database as well as a frontend app that interacts with the database.
